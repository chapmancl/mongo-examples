# Airbnb MCP Client

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client that connects to a MongoDB Atlas vector search MCP server and AWS Bedrock to process user queries using Claude LLM with tool support.

## Available Clients

### 1. `airbnb_mcp_cached.py` - Enhanced Client with Caching (Recommended)

The enhanced client provides comprehensive caching support and multi-MCP server capabilities:

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-MCP Server Support**: Can connect to and use tools from multiple MCP servers simultaneously
- **Advanced Caching System**: Implements multi-level caching including:
  - Bedrock message caching with smart cache point management
  - MCP tool discovery caching
  - Tool response caching with configurable TTL
  - Conversation history caching
- **Smart Cache Management**: Automatically manages Bedrock's 4 cache block limit
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Automatically discovers available MCP tools from configured servers
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for AWS and MCP server communications
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces API calls and improves response times through intelligent caching

**Usage:**
```bash
python airbnb_mcp_cached.py
```

**Interactive Commands:**
- `clear` - Clear conversation history and all caches  
- `cache stats` - Show detailed cache statistics
- `cache clear` - Clear all caches while keeping conversation history
- `<question>` - Ask Claude with full MCP tool support and caching

### 2. `airbnb-mcp.py` - Basic Client

A simpler client implementation without caching features.

## Python Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- AWS credentials configured (for Bedrock access)
- Access to a custom MCP server with MongoDB vector search capabilities

### 1. Create Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv .

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure your settings:

1. Copy or create a `settingsairbnb.py` file with your configuration:
   - AWS region settings
   - MongoDB MCP server connection details
      mongo_mcp is for the basic client, mongo_mcp_root is for the dynamic multi-mcp endpoint system.
   - Bedrock model ID

Example `settingsairbnb.py`:
```python
# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"
LLM_MODEL_ID = "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"

# MCP Server Configuration
mong_mcp = "http://localhost:8000/mcp/"
mongo_mcp_root = "http://localhost:8000" 
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python airbnb-mcp.py
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Enter questions directly to query Claude with MCP tool support
- Use `clear` command to clear conversation history and tools
- Press Ctrl+C to exit

## Features

- **MCP Tool Integration**: Automatically discovers and uses tools from connected MCP servers
- **AWS Bedrock Integration**: Uses Claude LLM via AWS Bedrock Converse API
- **Conversation History**: Maintains context across multiple queries


## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured
- Verify your MCP server is running and accessible
- Make sure you have the necessary AWS Bedrock model access permissions
- Make sure to use the Cross-region inference profile ID for the given model.
